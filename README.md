## 📖 Description

**EduTrack** is a centralized **School & Learning Management System (LMS)** built using the **MERN stack**.  
It enables institutions to create classes, enroll students, manage assignments, collect submissions, and facilitate grading and academic feedback all within a single platform.

The system supports two primary roles:
- **Instructors**, who manage classes and assignments
- **Students**, who submit work and receive feedback

EduTrack provides a structured, secure, and role-based academic environment that mirrors real-world school systems.

## 💡 Background & Motivation

EduTrack was created to address a common challenge in academic environments:
Many institutions depend on multiple tools like emails, messaging apps, and cloud storage, which often leads to missed deadlines, unclear feedback, and poor organization.

EduTrack centralizes the entire academic workflow into one platform, offering:
- Complete assignment management from creation to grading
- Secure, role-based access for instructors and students
- Transparent tracking of grades and feedback
